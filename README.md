======================

A 3D voxel-based attempt to do something similar to Dwarf Fortress.

This project is largely incomplete, and is basically my first foray into straight OpenGL 3.0 coding.

It is built in Code::Blocks, using MinGW GCC, and expects the following libraries: Boost, FreeGLUT, GLEW, and libnoise.
