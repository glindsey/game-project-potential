	<!-- Sugar is a tough one.  It is typically granular, but can also be compressed into lumps, cubes, et cetera.  For simplicity's sake I'm going to say that the "solid" form of sugar is simply "rock sugar", even though in reality there's a difference between compressed granules of sugar and whole sugar crystals. -->
