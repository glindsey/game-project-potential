<name>oil of vitriol</name>
<description>Sulfuric acid is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula H2SO4. It is a colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid which is soluble in water at all concentrations. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.

For the purposes of this game we assume the acid is at about 30% dilution (battery acid), which will not freeze at game temperatures.</description>
