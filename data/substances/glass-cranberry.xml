<description>Cranberry glass (or 'Gold Ruby' glass as it is known in Europe, or 'Rubino Oro' as it is known by glass workers) is a red glass made by adding gold(III) oxide to molten glass. Tin, in the form of stannous chloride, is sometimes added in tiny amounts as a reducing agent. The glass is used primarily in expensive decorations.</description>
